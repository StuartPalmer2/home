<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">In
2014, a new course (subject) in design and manufacturing with composite
materials was offered at the Griffith School of Engineering and Built
Environment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A previous evaluation of
the initial course offering found that the students generally perceived the
course to be valuable, and it also offered insights into potential areas for
improvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the subsequent three
offerings of the course (2016, 2017 and 2018), a range of deliberate changes to
the course learning design were made, with the aim of improving student
learning and engagement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An inspection of
the data from the university student evaluation instrument for the first four
course offerings showed essentially no change in mean ratings for the
quantitative scale items, even though aspects of the course learning design had
been deliberately changed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="AAEEHeading1" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PURPOSE OR GOAL</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Limitations
with the ability of quantitative scale item student evaluation data to reveal
meaningful variation in response to changes in learning designs are described
in the literature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The university
student evaluation also included the option for students to provide open-ended
text comments about the course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
investigation was undertaken to determine if computer-based analysis of the
student comments (text analytics) could identify differences in the students&rsquo;
perceptions of the course that related to the changes in the course learning
design over the first four course offerings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="AAEEHeading1" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">APPROACH OR
METHODOLOGY/METHODS</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The
quantitative scale item data were analysed to identify any significant
differences in the mean student ratings over the first four course offerings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A text analytics method (multidimensional
scaling) was applied to the pooled student open-ended comments to visualise and
identify any themes that might reveal differences in the students&rsquo; perceptions
of the first four offerings of the course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="AAEEHeading1" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED
OUTCOMES</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The
statistical analysis of the quantitative scale item data showed no significant differences
in the mean student ratings over the first four course offerings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The text analytics analysis revealed clusters
of terms in the student open-ended comments related to the year of offer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term clusters observed did capture
aspects of the intentional changes to the learning design over the first four
offerings of the course, providing some evidence that students did actually perceive
these intentional course learning design changes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="AAEEHeading1" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY</span>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The
text analytics method did reveal additional useful course evaluation
information present in the open-ended comments provided by students.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This qualitative data source, which many evaluation
instruments routinely collect, offered a valuable complement to the
quantitative scale item data which are traditionally the focus in institutional
student evaluation of teaching processes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have documented here a method for the analysis of the open-ended
course evaluation comments provided by students that is likely to be valuable
to others involved in engineering education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
