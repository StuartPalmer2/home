      <p><font face="Arial"><b><a name="Succeed"><font color="#0000ff">How to succeed in your final-year project</font></a></b></font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial">Your final-year project is the single largest
          piece of work you will complete as an undergraduate, the biggest item
          in the calculation of honours and one of the most important things
          potential employers will look at.&nbsp; You should plan to achieve the
          best result possible.</font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Start early</u> - think about possible
          project topics before SEJ343, discuss your ideas with potential
          supervisors and industrial partners.</font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Start early</u> - commence your project work
          as soon as you can after confirming your topic and supervisor.</font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Start early</u> - write your final report as
          you go, start with an empty document with only the headings of the
          required sections, and fill it up as your project progresses - don't
          leave your write-up until the end.</font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Follow the guidelines</u> given in the course
          notes and the unit guide - for your project brief, proposal, interim
          reports, oral presentation and final report.</font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Always re-use your work</u> - any work in
          your brief should be re-used in your proposal, and any work in your
          proposal should be re-used in your final report.</font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Stick to your schedule</u> - for your
          proposal you will develop a project schedule, display it somewhere
          prominently and check each week that you are on track - if not, take
          action to regain progress, if this is not possible see your supervisor
          as soon as possible.</font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Keep busy</u> - sometimes progress in one
          area is delayed, don't wait, do something else - use the time to write
          up everything you've done so far.</font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Keep in touch</u> with your supervisor - keep
          your supervisor informed of progress and/or any problems - don't
          'surprise' your supervisor with your problems when it is too late to
          take any action.</font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Don't confuse your project and the unit
          requirements</u> - for your project (particularly if you're an
          off-campus student), you will be doing certain work, this work is
          important and is the basis for your final-year project, but you need
          to keep in mind there is much more required to complete the project
          unit - apart from the project work you are demonstrating your skills
          in project planning, written and oral communication, research and
          literature review, experimental design, analysis of data, etc.&nbsp; 
          The 'significance' of the technical work you complete for your project 
          is only <u>one</u> of the criterion upon which your final project 
          report will be assessed. </font></p>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>You're telling a story</u> - For both your
          project proposal and your final report you will find there is a
          prescribed format for presentation, it is not arbitrary, it is
          designed to provide the reader with a logical sequence that tells a
          story, for example in the final report you have:</font></p>

          
      <ul>

            <li><font face="Arial"><b>Introduction</b>: the background and rationale
              for the project, including specific aims/outcomes;</font></li>

            <li><font face="Arial"><b>Literature Review</b>: a critical review
              of the related literature that provides general and specific information
              that is the foundation for the chosen project methodology;</font></li>

            <li><font face="Arial"><b>Methodology</b>: what you actually did and 
            why you did it, such that
              someone could reproduce your work if they had to (should make
              sense in light of the information presented in the literature
              review);</font></li>

            <li><font face="Arial"><b>Results</b>: what you
              found/produced/discovered/etc;</font></li>

            <li><font face="Arial"><b>Discussion</b>: a critical analysis of the
              results/outcomes;</font></li>

            <li><font face="Arial"><b>Conclusion</b>: tying the whole thing up by
              comparing the results with the originally stated aims, i.e., how
              successful was the project?</font></li>

          
      </ul>

          
      <p><font face="Arial"><u>Do more than the bare minimum</u> - your
          final-year project is not the place to do just what you have to do to
          pass, this is the place where you should aim for the best result - if
          you go the extra mile, you will reap the rewards.</font></p>
