        </font><font face="Arial">Frequency domain analysis (FDA) encompasses a 
        range of mathematical research techniques for revealing the frequency/spectral components 
        of data, which often permits new insights into the fundamental 
        mechanisms behind the data.</font>
      
      
      
      <p><font face="Arial">The diagram 
        below shows monthly average temperature data from Casey base in 
        Antarctica in red, and a Fourier transform of the of the data in blue.&nbsp; 
        The frequency domain representation shows that the data is composed of a 
        small number of dominant frequencies and some 'noise'.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">It is also possible to analyse the frequency 
        components of 2D data, including images.&nbsp; The image below shows an 
        internal courtyard of L'H&ocirc;tel des Invalides in Paris.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">By extracting the horizontal and vertical discrete 
        Fourier transforms of the image, and converting these to periodograms 
        (period = 1/frequency), we can quantitatively extract information about 
        the principal architectural features in the image.&nbsp; The horizontal 
        periodogram is given below.&nbsp; The peaks indicate three main 
        horizontal feature dimensions of approximately 22, 39 and 44 pixels.&nbsp; 
        For comparison, the average height of the people in the image is about 
        20 pixels.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">Another important tool in FDA is the wavelet 
        transform.&nbsp; This tool reveals not only the spectral components in 
        data, but also how those components vary with respect to the independent 
        variable (time, displacement, etc).&nbsp; Wavelet analysis of the Casey 
        temperature data suggests that the temperature data could be modelled by 
        the sum of three principal frequency components plus the addition of two 
        normally distributed random noise components.</font></p>




        
      
      
      
      <p><font face="Arial">The 2D discrete wavelet transform decomposes an 
        image into an orthogonal set of sub-images representing horizontal, 
        vertical and diagonal frequency components at dyadic scales.&nbsp; This 
        ability to capture image features at different scales and orientations 
        means that the 2DDWT is an excellent method for representing texture.&nbsp; 
        Consider the carbon fibre composite sample below.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">We can use wavelet texture analysis to 
        automatically classify the surface finish into 'good' and 'bad' 
        categories.&nbsp; Taking a set of 11 samples, 1-5 were good, and 6-11 
        were bad.&nbsp; We use the 2DDWT decomposition to create a texture 
        feature vector set.&nbsp; Using principal components analysis we can 
        devise a linear combination of the feature vector elements that explains 
        a majority of the variation in the original images.&nbsp; Plotting the 
        1st and 2nd principal components, we can locate the original samples in 
        the texture space.&nbsp; Note that all the good sample are in the lower 
        half of the plot.&nbsp; We can now take an arbitrary sample, compute 
        the 2DDWT decomposition and using the 1st and 2nd principal components, 
        we can automatically classify the sample as good or bad.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">The diagram below shows daily average data for 
        water turbidity, and the continuous wavelet transform of that data.&nbsp; 
        The frequency domain representation shows strong components with a 
        90-120 period across all of the data, as well as higher frequency 
        components present around day 250.&nbsp; This raises the interesting 
        question of why these components are observed and what do they 
        represent?</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">Note in the diagram above that wavelet analysis 
        produces information from the data over a wide range of scales.&nbsp; 
        This enables it to characterise features that might exist in the same 
        data from the nano-scale to the macro-scale. </font></p>




        
      
      
      
      <p><font face="Arial">FDA can be a useful tool in the analysis of data 
        and the development of quantitative models based on data.&nbsp; Wavelet 
        analysis can also be used for data compression, noise removal and data 
        reconstruction.&nbsp; The diagrams below show raw experimental data in 
        red, and the de-noised signal obtained from wavelet analysis in blue.</font></p>
