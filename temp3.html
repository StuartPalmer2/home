<h3><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b>A broader
          conception of work-integrated learning for engineering and science</b><br>

<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In Australia, for
        decades, there has been a requirement for 12 weeks of &lsquo;work experience&rsquo;
        for graduate membership of the engineering profession, and for many
        years most Australian engineering schools have subsumed this industry
        placement as a hurdle requirement for graduation.&nbsp; More recently,
        some engineering schools have framed this industry placement as a
        work-integrated learning (WIL) experience that is assessed for course
        credit.&nbsp; Without external accreditation, WIL in tertiary science
        courses has historically been less common, although some WIL
        opportunities, including for course credit, have never-the-less
        existed.&nbsp; In 2015, the Office of the Chief Scientist recommended
        that all Australian undergraduate science programs include a work
        placement.&nbsp; In the case of both engineering and science, key aims
        of such WIL placements are to develop a deeper understanding of
        discipline practice, and to enhance graduate employability.</span></p>

      The Australian census and national graduate outcomes data reveal a stark
      reality for many graduates of engineering and science university
      courses.&nbsp; Over the last decade, graduate employment in these
      disciplines has declined.&nbsp; Graduates in work are also less likely to
      be working in the discipline area that they studied.&nbsp; It is not
      merely that we need to produce &lsquo;better&rsquo; graduate engineers and
      scientists.&nbsp; The census also shows that there are far fewer
      professional job roles available than there are graduates.&nbsp; Many
      Australian engineering and science graduates must work outside of their
      discipline if they wish to work at all.&nbsp; There is also existing
      research internationally that highlights that not all students enrolled in
      engineering and science courses intend to pursue careers in those
      disciplines.<br>

      <br>

      WIL is often framed as an opportunity for students to apply
      discipline-specific knowledge in a workplace context.&nbsp; There have
      been many calls to make engineering and science curricula more
      &lsquo;authentic&rsquo;.&nbsp; The actual occupational outcomes for engineering and
      science graduates suggest that an authentic undergraduate curriculum is
      one that deliberately addresses graduate employment outcomes beyond the
      profession in its: philosophy and vision; student recruitment; intended
      learning outcomes; learning designs; curriculum content; assessment; and,
      most especially in its employability studies, including WIL.&nbsp; A
      broader conception of WIL in engineering and science is required.<br>

      This chapter addresses the aims of the publication through:<br>

      - highlighting the enduring value of WIL in engineering and science
      education;<br>

      - analysing the latest Australian data on graduate occupational outcomes
      for engineering and science;<br>

      - recommending changes to engineering and science curricula relating to
      WIL; and<br>

      - proposing a research agenda to evaluate the impact of these changes.<br>
