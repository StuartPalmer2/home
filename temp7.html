<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">In
the face of static and then declining domestic enrolments in Australian
university engineering education in recent years, the sector has continued to
grow through a significant increase in international student enrolments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latest available data (2017) indicate
that the annual growth in international student enrolments in coursework master&rsquo;s
courses has been two to three times that of any other engineering student group
in recent years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Predictably, engineering
coursework master&rsquo;s courses have been driving the growth of many Australian
engineering academic units.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anecdotal
evidence indicates that master of engineering management courses and master of
engineering courses with an engineering management major sequence are popular,
with many Australian engineering academic units offering such courses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p class="AAEEHeading1" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PURPOSE OR GOAL</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">At
Deakin University, enrolments into the engineering management major sequence of
the Master of Engineering (Professional) course have outnumbered enrolments
into other engineering discipline areas.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As an element of the university major course review process for the Master
of Engineering (Professional) course, the engineering management major sequence
was reviewed to ensure its educational and professional value, as well as its market
attractiveness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To help inform this
review, a benchmarking investigation of master&rsquo;s-level coursework engineering
management courses in Australia was undertaken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

METHODOLOGY/METHODS</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">A
survey of the websites of all Australian university engineering academic units
was conducted in 2018 to identify publicly available master of engineering
management courses and master of engineering courses with an engineering
management major sequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
structures of these identified courses were examined, and all units of study
relating to engineering management were identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The titles of all the identified units of
study were used as the input to a text analytics analysis and visualisation
process, to identify the relative frequency of, and relationship between, the
key engineering management themes, and to inform the overall review of the
engineering management major sequence of the Master of Engineering (Professional)
course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

OUTCOMES</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">In addition to the Deakin University
course major sequence, the survey identified 11 master of engineering
management courses and master of engineering courses with an engineering
management major sequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These courses
and major sequences contained 194 units of study, and the titles of these units
contained more than 700 words which were used as the input for a text analytics
analysis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A co-occurrence network
visualisation of the engineering management themes embodied in the unit titles
was produced as an input into the major sequence review process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p class="AAEEHeading1" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY</span>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">A
new four-unit engineering management major sequence was proposed for the Master
of Engineering (Professional) course at Deakin University.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale for, and details of, the
proposed new major sequence are presented.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The proposed four-unit major sequence has many elements in common with the
model structure for management studies in engineering undergraduate courses
that formed part of the Australian engineering course accreditation
requirements in the 1990s, and points to the enduring relevance and popularity of
management education for engineering students of all levels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The text analytics method presented may be a
useful tool for others undertaking similar course benchmarking exercises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
