<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The
spread of Coronavirus disease has left public universities counting the cost of
the Australian Government&rsquo;s decision to close borders. Schools of Engineering
across Australia, saw a rapid decline in revenue in 2020-2021 and their
sustainability and over reliance on income from international students has come
under question. A knee-jerk reaction has been to conceptualise new program
models or delivery approaches. However, this alone does not go far enough in
addressing the sustainability question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="AAEEHeading1" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE OR GOA</span>L<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">There
are three fundamental questions that need to be addressed to unpack what it
means to develop a sustainable postgraduate engineering program: the cost of
the degree, the overall student experience and graduate outcomes. While Australia&rsquo;s
skilled migration policy can have an influence in international student
interest in postgraduate coursework degrees beyond 2022, it is also important
to consider student perspectives to design such sustainable programs. As
international students were only included in the Quality Indicators for
Learning and Teaching surveys 2016-2017, their experiences have only come to
the fore recently and does not fully represent the cohort experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="AAEEHeading1" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">APPROACH OR
METHODOLOGY/METHODS</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Our
mixed method study, which uses students as partners in the data collection and
analysis process, explored student motivations, aspirations and expectations
from a master&rsquo;s degree in engineering. We presented outcomes from our study
focussed on the quantitative aspects of the data (Krishnan, Campanale &amp;
Palmer, 2020). The investigation also collected qualitative data in the form of
open-ended text-based response from student participants to a range of
questions related to their motivations for, and experiences of, study in
Australia. Here we use text analysis and visualisation to identify and explore
the themes present in the students&rsquo; responses to the study&rsquo;s prompting
questions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

OUTCOMES</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">In
this paper, we present our findings from looking deeply into what international
students want from coursework master&rsquo;s degrees and by asking the questions
about what it means to support their engagement in learning and what it means
to nurture their development. The open-ended text responses from students to
five prompting questions included more than 2600 words. Co-occurrence network
visualisations were produced for each of the response text sets to assist in
the interpretation of the student responses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">In
this paper we present the motivations, aspirations, expectations and
perceptions of international students in a postgraduate coursework engineering
degree and seek to contribute to the development of strategies that can have a
positive impact on their learning for professional employment. We believe that
critical to improving graduate employability is providing students with
multiple and diverse Work Integrated Learning (WIL) opportunities &lsquo;within or
beyond the formal curriculum&rsquo; to bridge the cognitive gap in their
understanding for how their educational experience will prepare them for
professional work. The text analytics method presented may be a useful tool for
others undertaking similar evaluations of student experiences based on text
data from surveys, interviews or focus groups.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
