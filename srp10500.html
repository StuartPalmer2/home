        Professional Engineers for the 21st Century<br>
        </u></b></p>
        <p>Lloyd, B E, Ferguson, C, Palmer, S and Rice, MR, <b>Engineering
        the Future: Preparing Professional Engineers for the 21st
        Century</b>, A4, 200 pp., published by APESMA in
        association with Histec Publications, May 2001.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The book looks behind the historical development of
        events and issues that have shaped the engineering
        profession in Australia within the context of the
        historical, social and global development of the
        profession. The analysis leads to a wide-ranging
        discussion on the future of the Australian engineering
        profession.</p>
        <p>Lloyd is the principal contributor on concepts of
        professionalism and on future needs for effective
        practice of engineering. As a Past President of the
        Institution of Engineers, Australia, directly responsible
        for many initiatives of the Engineering team, he is a
        well seasoned researcher in this area.</p>
        <p>Chapters by Rice focus on statistical analysis of
        engineer populations and projections, to provide
        significant insights into the national and global
        environment in which engineers work. Rice is the
        acknowledged Australian expert on these matters.</p>
        <p>Recognising the increasing significance of continuing
        professional development, the book also includes chapters
        by Ferguson and Palmer on new developments in engineering
        education. Ferguson discusses the new development of
        graduate attributes, an approach that is changing the
        focus of engineering education, and considers the
        broadening range of teaching strategies that need to be
        employed. He also discusses issues involved in distance
        education. Palmer gives particular focus to the teaching
        of engineering management in engineering undergraduate
        courses, a question still neglected by many engineering
        schools. </p>
        <p>The book goes well beyond academic interests, and is
        of value for all engineers interested in maintaining
        their profession. There are strong messages for IEAust
        concerning the future relevance of the Institution to the
        profession. Those who work in fields associated with the
        engineering profession also will find compelling reading
        in the book.</p>
        <p>Available from Histec Publications, 13 Connor Street,
        Brighton East, Vic 3187.</p>
