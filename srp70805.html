Some stones, a carrot and a scarf are lying on the lawn <br>
Nobody put them on the lawn, but there is a perfectly logical
reason for their being there<br>
<b>What is it?</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>The four sheep</b> <br>
A farmer has four sheep <br>
One day he notices that they are standing in such a way that they
are all the same distance away from each other. That is to say,
the distance between any two sheep is the same <br>
<b>How can this be so?</b> </p>

<p><b>Vertical thinking</b> <br>
You may remember last time we spoke about vertical and lateral
thinking <br>
de Bono refers to 'vertical thinking' where we base our thought
processes on our prior knowledge, our experience and logic <br>
Our thought processes are based on assumptions and follow a
logical sequence </p>

<p>Vertical thinking is an automatic form of thinking that is
based on patterns that we are familiar with <br>
It helps us function in day to day life <br>
It stops us from stepping off high buildings and walking in front
of traffic <br>
We automatically know the logical consequences if we do these
things </p>

<p>Vertical thinking is an automatic form of thinking that is
based on patterns that we are familiar with <br>
This is the natural form of thinking <br>
It constrains our creativity and ability to solve problems </p>

<p>Other factors constrain our creativity: </p>

<ul>
    <li>experience tells us the &quot;right&quot; way to do it</li>
    <li>the typical design process is not creative</li>
    <li>organisations are conservative</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><b>Creative thinking</b> <br>
de Bono uses the following diagram to show the nature of creative
thinking and vertical thinking</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img src="img00019.gif" width="345"
height="145"> </p>

<p>We normally proceed down the vertical thinking path <br>
If we were to examine every possible side track, life would be
impossibly slow <br>
Optimal or useful solutions to some of our problem may exist on
these side tracks <br>
Under normal conditions we will pass them by </p>

<p align="left">Here are some additional terms defined using the
previous diagram</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img src="img00020.gif" width="345"
height="145"> </p>

<p>All creative ideas are logical in hindsight, otherwise they
would have no value <br>
de Bono says that the mistake that many people make is to
conclude that the creative solution could have been reached
logically and linearly in the first place <br>
It is important to understand that the path from A to B is very
different to that from B to A </p>

<p align="left">de Bono likens creative insight to humour <br>
As the joke unfolds, we form a normal, vertical understanding of
the story <br>
When the punchline is delivered, we immediately see an
alternative view of the same story <br>
For example ... </p>

<p align="left"><b>Creative thinking and humour</b> <br>
Greg Norman had a bad Christmas, <br>
he was given only three golf clubs, <br>
and only two of them had pools! </p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img src="img00021.gif" width="345"
height="144"> </p>

<p><b>Creative thinking</b> <br>
de Bono concludes that the same type of pattern switching that we
see in humour also occurs in hindsight (the B to A path) and
insight (the A to B path) <br>
The purpose of lateral thinking is to provide a more deliberate
means for pattern switching than relying on mistake or accident </p>

<p><b>Lateral thinking</b> <br>
While lateral thinking may not be the normal form of thinking, <br>
it is not a mystical black art that you are either born with, or
you aren't <br>
Much like public speaking, leadership, etc, it can be learned,
practised and developed </p>

<p>A set of systematic techniques used for changing concepts and
perceptions and generating new ones <br>
More generally - exploring multiple possibilities and approaches
instead of pursuing a single approach </p>

<p>Lateral thinking is NOT 'brainstorming' </p>

<p>De Bono refers to brainstorming is an undisciplined form of
creative thinking that may be suitable for advertising where
anything is possible, <br>
but it is of limited use in solving 'real world' problems </p>

<p><b>Uses of lateral thinking</b> <br>
<b>Improvement</b> - removing defects and 'making it better' <br>
<b>Problem solving</b> - finding a solution, or a better solution
to a problem <br>
<b>Value and opportunity</b> - creating competitive advantage is
business <br>
<b>The future</b> - creative planning <br>
<b>Motivation</b> - creativity can be a great motivator </p>

<p><b>Improvement</b> - de Bono sees this is the area of greatest
potential for lateral thinking <br>
It is about removing defects, but also about improving what is
already working <br>
<b>Problem solving</b> - the traditional area for creative
thinking <br>
The standard solution or the first solution are not necessarily
the best <br>
Incorporates problem avoidance </p>

<p><b>Value and opportunity</b> - business has been through
reorganisation and cost cutting <br>
Many are now addressing quality <br>
Once all your competitors are lean and competent, how do you gain
a competitive advantage? <br>
By creatively finding and creating new product values and
completely new business opportunities </p>

<p><b>The future</b> - strategy is often about reducing
possibilities to a single course of action <br>
Creative planning is about designing multiple options <br>
<b>Motivation</b> - creativity can make people interested in what
they are doing, it creates opportunity for achievement and for
teamwork </p>

<p><b>Characteristics of creative thinkers</b> <br>
Tanner offers the following characteristics of creative thinkers
... </p>

<p><b>Discontent with the status quo</b> - trouble makers <br>
<b>Seek alternative solutions</b> - don't grab at the first
solution that arises <br>
<b>Are prepared</b> (to think creatively) <br>
<b>Think positively</b> - find new angles on what would normally
be considered negatives <br>
<b>Work hard at it</b> - the one common characteristic found
among creative thinkers </p>

<p><b>Lateral thinking techniques</b> <br>
de Bono has provided the world with a number of techniques that
can be used to stimulate lateral thinking </p>

<p>The 6 hats <br>
The creative pause <br>
Focus <br>
Challenge <br>
Alternatives <br>
Provocation </p>

<p align="left"><b>The chess masters</b> <br>
Two grandmasters played five games of chess. <br>
Each won the same number of games and lost the same number of
games. <br>
There were no draws in any game<br>
<b>How could this be so?</b></p>

<p align="center"><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img src="img00022.gif" width="389"
height="246"> </p>

<p><b>The creative pause</b> <br>
Unless there is some obstacle, or we consciously stop, our
thinking flows along smoothly - this is vertical thinking <br>
Unless we purposefully make an effort to apply creative thinking,
then it will only occur by chance, if it occurs at all </p>

<p align="left">The creative pause <br>
is a purposeful, proactive effort to employ creative thinking <br>
It is an interruption in the smooth flow of routine in order to
pay deliberate attention to some point <br>
It is not a creative thinking technique in itself - the value of
the pause is not in what we do during the pause, but in the
distraction it provides</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img src="img00023.gif" width="345"
height="145"> </p>

<p>The 'green hat' is a formal way of asking for creative effort <br>
The pause asks: <br>
&quot;There could be a new idea here&quot; <br>
&quot;Is there another possibility here&quot; <br>
&quot;Is that the only way of doing it?&quot; <br>
de Bono suggests a pause of 20-30 seconds for individuals, two
minutes for a group </p>

<p>The creative pause is a vital habit of the successful problem
solver and creative thinker </p>

<p><b>Focus</b> <br>
When we apply creative thinking, we need to focus on something <br>
Focus can be applied randomly, or specifically <br>
There are an infinite number of random focus points, ie. <br>
why do I have to stand in line at the airport? <br>
why do I have to hold the nozzle to pump petrol into my car? </p>

<p>The ability to identify and develop new ideas has made many
people wealthy <br>
The inventor of the variable speed windscreen wiper solved their
problem of a fixed wipe speed being either too fast or too slow,
and made their fortune as well <br>
Focus is another habit of the practicing creative thinker </p>

<p>Specific focus can be: <br>
<b>General</b> - &quot;we need some new ideas about
telephones&quot;; or <br>
<b>Purposeful</b> - &quot;how can we use telephones for
advertising?&quot; </p>

<p>de Bono identifies different types of purposeful focus: </p>

<p><b>Improvement</b> - &quot;how do we speed up supermarket
checkout?&quot;; <br>
<b>Problem solving</b> - &quot;how can we reduce losses from
shoplifting?&quot; <br>
<b>Task</b> - &quot;We need a flat computer monitor&quot; <br>
<b>Opportunity</b> - &quot;how can we use this glue that barely
sticks a scrap of paper?&quot; </p>

<p align="left">Six years after producing such an adhesive, 3M
finally found an answer and can still barely produce enough
PostIts to meet worldwide demand!</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img src="img00024.gif" width="369"
height="119"> </p>

<p>Focus is related to the concept of identifying the underlying
problem <br>
If the focus is to develop an improvement for umbrellas, <br>
perhaps we really should look at new ways of protecting people
from the rain </p>

<p><b>Challenge</b> <br>
Who knows why the keys on a computer keyboard are laid out in the
QWERTY arrangement we all know and love? <br>
The layout of the keys is purposefully convoluted and is actually
designed to slow down the possible speed of typing, because, on
early typewriters the mechanical arms that strike the carbon
ribbon would jam together if the typist was too quick </p>

<p>Does this make any sense today when virtually everyone uses a
computer that can respond to keystrokes at rate far faster than
any human could ever type? <br>
But, we continue this way because &quot;that's the way it has
always been done&quot; </p>

<p>Many aspects of our life are determined by conventions that
are now no longer relevant <br>
The creative challenge asks: <br>
&quot;Why is it done this way?&quot; <br>
&quot;Why does it have to be done this way?&quot; <br>
&quot;Are there other ways of doing it?&quot; <br>
The creative challenge does not set out to criticise, judge or
find fault, but <b>improve</b> </p>

<p align="left">Why are plates round? <br>
?Potter's wheels produce round objects <br>
?They are easy to set, the orientation is not important <br>
?People are used to them that way <br>
Many plates are now made by injection moulding <br>
They could be any shape we desire</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img src="img00025.gif" width="373"
height="145"> </p>

<p>Tradition, obsolete reasons, assumptions, apathy, domination,
avoidance, false arguments, etc. can lead us to accept things the
way they are <br>
Changes in technology, values, circumstances, costs, etc mean
that we should challenge what is taken for granted <br>
I am guilty of saying &quot;don't fix what ain't broke&quot; </p>

<p><b>Alternatives</b> <br>
A natural flow-on from the challenge is to develop alternatives
to the current method <br>
Where the next logical step is easily available, we do not
normally look for alternatives <br>
This is vertical thinking <br>
We need to consciously appreciate the need to look for
alternatives to the obvious </p>

<p>In some circumstances, there will be a limited number of
alternatives <br>
But, most situations are open ended <br>
We need to avoid traps like, &quot;Either we raise prices or we
don't&quot; </p>

<p>Maybe we can: <br>
raise some prices and lower others; <br>
raise prices but offer increases services, etc <br>
raise basic prices, but offer discounts; <br>
totally change our product range and set new prices! </p>

<p>When we have to generate new alternatives, <br>
we can employ a reference point <br>
Some common references points are: </p>

<p align="left"><b>Alternatives - reference points</b> <br>
<b>Purpose</b> - &quot;We have no matches, how else can we <b><i>light
a fire</i></b><b>?</b>&quot; <br>
<b>Groups</b> - &quot;Bananas are not available, what other <b><i>tropical
fruit</i></b><b> could we offer?</b>&quot; <br>
<b>Resemblance</b> - &quot;The anodisers are busy, how else can
we get this <b><i>surface finish</i></b><b>?</b>&quot; <br>
<b>Concepts</b> - &quot;We normally drive, what other ways are
there to <b><i>travel</i></b><b> from A to B?</b>&quot; </p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img src="img00026.gif" width="349"
height="189"> </p>

<p>There is no 'correct' reference point - <br>
try several </p>

<p><b>Creative thinking</b> <br>
Now it's time to solve a couple of small problems </p>

<p><b>Focus</b> - identify the key issues - what is the
underlying problem(s)? <br>
<b>Challenge</b> - why does it have to be done this way? - are
there other ways of doing it? <br>
<b>Alternatives</b> - search for alternatives - use reference
points - purpose, groups, resemblance, concepts </p>

<p><b>Provocation</b> <br>
Many important new ideas come about through accident, mistake or
'madness' <br>
All of these provide some discontinuity which forces us outside
of the normal boundaries of 'reasonableness' <br>
Deliberate provocation can produce the same effect, <br>
We can be mad for 30 seconds at a time, and then be sane again </p>

<p align="left">We said previously, all good ideas seem logical
in hindsight, but may not be able to be reached by logical,
linear thinking <br>
Provocation uses techniques to force us outside of logical
thought processes, <br>
from where we may be able to move on to a side track, find our
way back to where we started and open up a new idea</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img src="img00027.gif" width="389"
height="144"> </p>

<p>Provocation is one of the means by which we can make the
creative leap required in lateral thinking </p>

<p>de Bono offers the comparison from chemistry where to move
from one stable compound to another, we may have to first pass
through a temporary, unstable phase </p>

<p>Provocation is a two-stage process: <br>
we have to set up the provocation; then <br>
move on to generate a new idea </p>

<p>de Bono uses the term '<b>po</b>' as shorthand for
'provocation operation' when setting up provocations </p>

<p><b>Po - The escape method</b> <br>
Escape from what we take for granted <br>
We drive in to work <br>
<b>Po, you cannot drive in to work</b> <br>
cars are banned, we have to use public trans. <br>
you live on campus, or nearby <br>
you work at home <br>
you drive 'out' to work, businesses are encouraged to relocate
out of town </p>

<p><b>Po - Reversal</b> <br>
Reverse the usual direction of operation <br>
The phone rings when we get a call <br>
<b>Po, phones ring all the time &amp; stop on a call</b> <br>
a lamp is lit all the time the phone is working properly <br>
the phone can mute the television when a call is received </p>

<p><b>Po - Exaggeration</b> <br>
Increase or decrease the normal range / scale <br>
Police need eyes in the back of their heads <br>
<b>Po, police have six eyes</b> <br>
police on the beat have access to video surveillance cameras <br>
individuals act as extra eyes for the police - this idea lead to
the formation of Neighbourhood Watch programs </p>

<p><b>Po - Distortion</b> <br>
Change the normal arrangements <br>
What good are insurance benefits after you die? <br>
<b>Po, you are dead before you die</b> <br>
this provocation lead to the development of insurance policies
that pay benefits for certain terminal illnesses on diagnosis
rather than death <br>
it could also have initiated pre-paid funerals </p>

<p><b>Po - Wishful thinking</b> <br>
Fantasy - wouldn't it be nice if ... <br>
factories pollute the water for everyone downstream <br>
<b>Po, the factory is downstream of itself</b> <br>
many countries now legislate that factories that put effluent
into rivers must draw their intake water downstream of their
emission point </p>

<p align="left"><b>Po - The random input</b> <br>
If we have a stable, complex system, a random disturbance may
cause it to settle into a new rest state <br>
A powerful way to generate new ideas is to use a random
disturbance <br>
In provocation, we take a random word and juxtapose it with our
problem theme <br>
The illogical combination is a provocation that may lead to new
ideas</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img src="img00028.gif" width="345"
height="144"> </p>

<p><b>Cigarette po traffic light</b> <br>
put a red band around a cigarette near the butt to indicate a
'danger zone' <br>
as the last part of the cigarette is most harmful, stopping
before the band would be safer </p>

<p><b>Cigarette po flower</b> <br>
place seeds in the filters of cigarettes <br>
so that when the butt is thrown away on the ground, flowers might
grow <br>
if a particular type of flower was chosen, it might become a form
of advertising </p>

<p><b>Generating random inputs</b> <br>
To avoid any influence on the random input process we need a
pseudo-random source of words <br>
Compile a list of 60 words. To select, look at your watch and
note the position of the second hand, use that word <br>
Open a newspaper or book at random, close your eyes and point to
the page. Use the word closet to your finger </p>

<p><b>Provocation</b> <br>
Remember that provocation is a two-stage process: <br>
we have to set up the provocation; then <br>
move on to generate a new idea </p>

<p><b>Creative thinking - Provocation</b> <br>
<b>Escape</b> - from what we take for granted <br>
<b>Reverse</b> - the usual direction of operation <br>
<b>Exaggerate</b> - the normal range / scale <br>
<b>Distort</b> - the normal arrangements <br>
<b>Wishful thinking</b> - wouldn't it be nice if ... <br>
<b>Random input</b> - word association </p>

<p><b>Creative thinking</b> <br>
I have presented only a selection of de Bono's creative thinking
techniques <br>
de Bono is perhaps the most well known and published creative
thinker, <br>
but there are plenty of others, including detractors of de Bono <br>
I encourage you to read around on the topic, review it all
critically, and take from all sources what you find is valuable </p>

<p><b>Creative thinking</b> <br>
is like tennis <br>
Taking one lesson doesn't make you a Seles or a Woodford <br>
To excel at any task you must practise continually, and success
should motivate you to achieve more </p>

<p><b>Coins of the realm</b> <br>
<b>Why are 1898 pennies worth more than 1893 pennies?</b> </p>

<p align="left">For the same reason 20 pennies are worth more
than 15 pennies - </p>
