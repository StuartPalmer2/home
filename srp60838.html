<FONT SIZE=2>ABSTRACT: This paper presents a case study for consideration
in the context of undergraduate engineering studies in ethics.
The aim of this case study was to enhance and give focus to a
program of study encompassing the theory of ethics, professional
ethics and the social impact of technology. The meaning of 'ethics'
is clarified with definitions of ethics, morality and professional
ethics. The justifications and rationale for including ethics
in undergraduate engineering programs are examined. The typical
content and form of such a program is reviewed. The case study
presents, in chronological form, the scientific discoveries that
revealed the potential of atomic energy, the political and military
imperatives that initiated the race to develop atomic weapons,
the progress of the Manhattan project, and finally the circumstances
surrounding the actual use of these weapons against mainland Japan.
The historical events and the roles of technology professionals
in them are presented as impartially and objectively as possible.
Ethical questions posed to scientists, engineers and technologists
by the events documented in the case study are examined. The potential
benefits and limitations of the case study are discussed.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>INTRODUCTION<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The case study presented in this paper was developed
in response to a need to bring focus, relevance and impact to
engineering undergraduate studies in ethics. The 50th anniversary
of the first use of atomic weapons provided an excellent opportunity
to reflect on the ethical considerations involved in the development
and application of technology.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Most engineering undergraduate education programs
contain studies in the field of ethics. The challenge is (as with
any other area of study) to make these studies engaging to students
and relevant to the specific discipline of study. For engineering
it is also essential to ensure that consideration is given to
ethics in a context beyond the narrow focus of the application
of a professional code of ethics.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Manhattan project still represents one of the
greatest achievements of mankind in terms of the application of
science, engineering and technology. At the same time, it unleashed
the potential for incredibly destructive weapons, under who's
shadow the world has lived ever since. By reinforcing the fundamental
link between the scientific investigation and engineering achievement
of the project, and the consequences that followed, it is demonstrated
that science and technology are not 'value free', and that those
involved in such projects must continually make ethical choices
regarding the development and application of technology.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>DEFINITIONS<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the study of ethics it is important to define
what is meant by terms such as 'ethics', 'morals', 'ethical',
'moral', 'code of ethics' and 'professional ethics', as in some
circumstances these related terms are used interchangeably and
in others they are used to represent wholly different concepts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The term 'ethics' variously refers to; a) that branch
of philosophy concerned with the &quot;investigation into the
fundamental principles and concepts that are or ought to be found
in any given field of human thought or activity&quot; [1]; b)
more commonly, &quot;a set of standards by which a particular
group decides to regulate its behaviour - to distinguish what
is legitimate or acceptable in pursuit of their aims and what
is not&quot; [1]; and c) more loosely, any code of behaviour,
whether it claims moral justification or not [2].<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Some authors differentiate between 'morals' and 'ethics',
describing the former as 'rules of right conduct for individuals'
and the latter as 'moral principles and rules of conduct for the
behaviour of groups' [3], but often the terms are used interchangeably.
The case study does not make a distinction between these two terms.
Likewise, the terms 'ethical' and 'moral' are both used to describe
actions that conform to, or are in accordance with a particular
set of ethical or moral principles.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The term 'code of ethics' refers to the second definition
of ethics provided above - &quot;The purpose of these codes is
twofold: (1) to emphasize the broad general principles by which
all members of the profession should be guided, and (2) to indicate
how these principles apply in specific circumstances&quot; [4].
The 'Code of Ethics' published by the Institution of Engineers,
Australia (IEAust) [5] conforms to this definition, as do the
codes published by most professional bodies. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is suggested that there are four basic elements
in a true profession, &quot;(1) organization, (2) education, (3)
experience, and (4) exclusion&quot; [6]. 'Exclusion' (of the unfit
and unworthy) is achieved by the development and self-enforcement
of 'professional ethics', commonly in the form of a code of ethics
issued by the governing body of the profession. Engineering ethics
is then, &quot;concerned with the actions and decisions made by
persons, individually or collectively, who belong to the profession
of engineering&quot; [7].<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WHY TEACH ETHICS TO ENGINEERING STUDENTS?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The accrediting professional body for engineering
undergraduate courses in Australia, the IEAust, requires that
engineering undergraduate courses contain studies in ethics. Both
its 'Accreditation Policies and Procedures relating to Professional
Engineering Undergraduate Courses' [8] and 'National Competency
Standards for Professional Engineers' [9] contain explicit references
to the need for engineering students to acquire knowledge of professional
ethics, as well as containing other references to 'ethics'. On
joining the IEAust members must agree to abide by the code of
ethics, so graduate engineers must have an understanding of the
rationale for, and application of professional ethics. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is expected that members of a profession will
conduct themselves in an ethical manner. Engineering differs from
many other 'service' professions in that its principal function
is the design, production and operation of specific physical objects
- &quot;objects whose impact on individuals and on society as
a whole is observable and assessable with little or no consideration
of the role of the individual engineers who contributed to the
creation of these objects&quot; [7]. The high level of visibility
of the results and consequences of engineering activity mean that
it is essential that engineers gain an understanding that they
will have to make moral decisions, and that society will pass
judgement on their actions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We now live in a world where our actions may have
a significant impact on our environment. We also live in a world
that demands high levels of social responsibility from all the
professions. &quot;Increasingly, engineers are finding themselves
working on projects which are controversial; projects which are
considered by some to be compromising community interest&quot;
[10]. The recently released draft report of the Review of Engineering
Education includes as one of its recommendations that, &quot;...
all bachelor of engineering courses include basic science, engineering
fundamentals, management and business, ethics, with attention
to social, environmental, political and economic context, appropriately
integrated to provide a broad base relating to engineering practice
in a social context&quot; [11].<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As the nature of society and technology has changed,
so has the nature of the professions. The change in engineering
from collective 'trustee professionalism' to the 'expert professionalism'
of the individual has been noted by many authors. &quot;... expert
professionalism emphasised theoretical knowledge, but included
comparatively little concern with collegial organisations, ethical
standards, or service in the public interest&quot; [12]. &quot;This
new face of the professions is most evident amongst the independent
service providers who are increasingly subject to market pressures
...&quot; [13]. With a reduced public sector, many engineering
graduates will find employment in small to medium sized enterprises,
where they may have limited opportunity to find a mentor in the
form of a more experienced engineer. In this environment they
will have to be more self-sufficient in all forms of decision
making. Commercial pressures, organisational change and an increasingly
critical public will continue to pose new challenges to the professional
ethics of engineers. Engineers face an environment of ever-increasing
moral complexity, and they must be equipped to deal with the issues
they will face.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Regardless of the approach taken to teaching engineering
ethics, the central focus of such efforts should be the development
of students' autonomy in dealing with moral and ethical issues
in engineering. Moral autonomy involves 'moral reasonableness',
that is, moral beliefs that are rational, and 'authenticity',
that is, individual beliefs that are the result of critical evaluation
rather than passive adoption or reflection of the beliefs of others
[14]. The morally autonomous graduate engineer is well placed
to deal with the ethical questions that will inevitably and continually
arise throughout his or her career.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>THE TYPICAL ENGINEERING ETHICS SYLLABUS<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A review of the engineering undergraduate courses
offered by several Australian universities reveals that all those
examined include studies directed toward developing an understanding
of professional ethics and 'responsibility' [15] [16] [17] [18].
This is not surprising given the focus of the IEAust on professional
ethics in its guidelines for undergraduate studies [8].<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Accepting that the ethics content of engineering
undergraduate course at Deakin University is representative of
the typical engineering ethics syllabus, such a syllabus will
include the elements shown in Figure 1 below. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The first four items establish the nature of the
profession of engineering and its relationship to technology and
society. The second four items pursue the ethical issues that
arise from the first four. In addition to the concept and application
of professional codes of ethics, and in particular the IEAust
code of ethics, it is essential that the general field of ethics,
moral decision making and the ethics of technology be covered
in detail. A truly 'morally autonomous' engineer must be equipped
to make moral decisions in professional circumstances beyond the
necessarily limited scope of the published code of ethics. A narrow
focus on the use of codes of ethics, technical specialisation
and the status of the profession, termed 'micro-ethics', should
be avoided in preference for a broader focus on the responsibility
of the profession and the role of technology in society, referred
to as 'macro-ethics' [20].<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CASE STUDY<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The challenge in presenting any 'non-technical' course
content to engineering students is to make it relevant and engaging.
This is especially true of a topic such as ethics, which can potentially
viewed from a students' perspective as a highly theoretical exercise
with limited relevance to the real world, or at the other extreme,
challenging and confronting to the students' personal beliefs
and ideals. It is within the context of wishing to ensure a macro-ethical
approach as well as improving the engagement of undergraduate
students in the learning process that the case study described
in this paper was developed. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There exists no shortage of published resources and
documented case studies dealing with professional ethics in the
context of applying and interpreting relevant codes of ethics
[4] [21], but the aim here was a macro- rather than micro-ethical
approach. At the time I was searching for an actual occurrence
that involved engineering, technology and moral decisions, there
was a very public remembrance of the 50th anniversary of the use
of the first atomic bomb. The development and use of the first
atomic weapons is well documented and remains one of the greatest
achievements of science and engineering in the technological sense.
It is also one of the most controversial projects in terms of
the moral justification of both the development phase and actual
use of the weapons. Here then was the case study I was looking
for.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>THE CASE STUDY<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Based on published accounts from a large number of
sources, the case study documents, in the form of a time line,
and objectively as possible, the scientific, social, political
and military events spanning the discovery of the nuclear structure
of atoms through to the use of atomic weapons against the Japanese
in 1945. The time line format allows students to study the events
leading up to the use of nuclear weapons in the correct temporal
and causal sequence. Commencing the case study with the scientific
discoveries that underpin nuclear power allows students to grasp
the relationship between scientific research and the final application
of technology. The following are selected segments of the case
study time line.<BR>

neutrons, which can split further uranium atoms, which produces
more neutrons in an ever increasing release of energy called a
chain reaction.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>APPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE CASE STUDY<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The case study presents a context in which to introduce
and discuss macro-ethical considerations for engineering students.
This can be used to complement and balance a study program that
examines micro-ethical issues, such as hypothetical situations
involving moral choices for individual engineers, particularly
those referring to the IEAust code of ethics. The case study is
intended as a student resource that forms part of a complete ethics
syllabus as outlined in Figure 1 above.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The case study was developed for use in engineering
and technology undergraduate education, but the nature of the
material lends itself to the teaching of science students as well,
particularly those studying chemistry or physics. Used in the
context of discussing the impacts of technology and ethical considerations
in the link between research and development and the consequences
of technology, the case study has wide applicability.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though the case study is based on events that
occurred long before the birth of most of today's undergraduates,
the history of the Manhattan project is still fascinating to anyone
involved in science and technology, and the consequences of the
development and use of nuclear power will continue to be relevant
for the foreseeable future. The 50th anniversary of the use of
nuclear weapons was quickly followed by French nuclear testing
in the south pacific, the resumption of Chinese nuclear testing,
the complications of the nuclear test ban treaty, and most recently
renewed discussion about Australia's three uranium mine policy.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As a tool for provoking thought and moral debate,
the case study achieved success even in the development phase,
with different colleagues respectfully and variously suggesting
that it presented in a bad light the Allies, the Japanese, the
military, scientists and engineers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The case study was developed to be used at first
year undergraduate level, but the nature of the issues addressed
in the case could be presented and discussed at any level. While
no formal evaluation of the case study has yet been undertaken,
students were given the opportunity to select the topic 'The ethics
of the development and use of the atomic bomb in World War II',
from a list of four topics relating to the course material, as
the basis for their major semester essay. Of the students who
elected to consider this topic, their concluding remarks ranged
from unequivocal support for the use of atomic weapons by the
Americans, to quoting the accounts of survivors from Hiroshima.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though every effort has been made to present
the circumstances surrounding the development and use of nuclear
weapons objectively, success in this area is necessarily limited
by the availability and accuracy of the information sources used
and the editing of those sources into a case study. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CONCLUSION<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The members of the professions, including engineering,
find themselves in a world of ever increasing ethical complexity,
brought about by increasing social and commercial pressures, and
by changes in the nature of the professions themselves. To enable
engineering graduates to deal effectively with these challenges
we must ensure that, as students, they develop moral autonomy.
To achieve this they must be exposed to a wide range of ethical
issues including, the nature of ethics and moral decision making,
and the relationship between science, engineering, technology
and society, as well as the concept of professional ethics and
the application of the code of ethics. The case study presented
provides a context in which to introduce and discuss macro-ethical
considerations for engineering students.<BR>
