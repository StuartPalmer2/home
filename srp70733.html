<p><b>Leadership - a definition</b> <br>
The ability to get work done with and through others, while at
the same time winning their confidence, respect, loyalty and
willing cooperation </p>

<p>The first part of the definition could be a definition of
management <br>
The complete definition highlights the difference between simply
managing and being a leader </p>

<p><b>Leadership</b> <br>
Leaders influence many aspects of work, they: </p>

<p>are the chief communicator of the group; <br>
affect motivation by their behaviour; and <br>
are responsible for the group&#146;s objectives being understood
and achieved <br>
As leadership is a critical influence of group performance, <br>
it is worth understanding more about leadership and what makes an
effective leader </p>

<p><b>Effective leadership</b> <br>
Contrary to popular belief, no one is born a leader <br>
But some people do have certain abilities that predispose them to
developing into a leader <br>
Like public speaking, and many other skills, leadership can be
learned and developed </p>

<p>While there is no agreed list of qualities that make a good
leader <br>
And different leadership styles suit different situations <br>
It is widely agreed that leaders tend to have the following
characteristics: </p>

<p>Intelligence<font face="Times New Roman,Times"> </font><font
face="Symbol">¹ </font>academic achievement <br>
Social maturity = emotional maturity and a wide range of
interests <br>
Self-motivation and an achievement orientation <br>
Self confidence and good communications skills </p>

<p><b>Theories of leadership</b> <br>
There has been a lot of research into styles of leadership <br>
And the general conclusion is that a leader&#146;s concern for
production needs to be balanced with a concern for subordinates </p>

<p>Robert Blake and Jane Mouton have devised the &#145;Management
Grid&#146; <br>
This is a framework for identifying a range of leadership styles <br>
Based on combinations of concern for people and concern for
production </p>

<p align="center"><b>&nbsp;The Blake and Mouton &#145;Management
Grid&#146;</b></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="m_grid.jpg" width="520"

<p align="left">Blake and Mouton argue that the 9.9 management
style is the most effective type of leadership behaviour <br>
This approach will generally result in improved performance, low
absenteeism and turnover and high employee satisfaction </p>

<p><b>Situational leadership</b> <br>
We find that much of the recent research highlights the influence
of situational factors on which leadership style a manager should
use </p>

<p>Hersey and Blanchard&#146;s leadership theory says that a
leader must chose a style that is appropriate for the situation <br>
ie. a manager leading an inexperienced group will need to spell
out what is required and closely supervise the work <br>
a manager of an experienced team is probably better off getting
out of their way and just monitoring their progress </p>

<p><b>Problem solving &amp; creativity</b> <br>
You will recall that we said leadership is just one of many
skills that can be learned and developed <br>
Well, so is problem solving and creativity <br>
In fact, de Bono says, creativity is not natural, and we have to
learn it </p>

<p>All through our life we subconsciously look for patterns which
help us predict the future <br>
ie, things fall down, the sun rises in the east, you can&#146;t
build a house out of plasticine, etc <br>
Over time we come to depend on these patterns, <br>
and they tend to control and limit both our actions and our
thinking </p>

<p>de Bono recounts from his University days how he was newly
arrived and couldn&#146;t get back before the gates were closed
at night <br>
A companion told him how to climb over the two fences to get in
after hours <br>
He climbed one high fence and jumped to the ground <br>
He got up and climbed the next fence only to find himself outside
again - HOW? </p>

<p>&nbsp;He had climbed over near a corner and climbed out again
over the nearest fence, which was the other outer wall <br>
When he went around to the front gate, he discovered it had been
open all the time <br>
He had just imagined that it was closed, because that&#146;s how
it was done normally </p>

<p>de Bono talks about &#145;vertical thinking&#146; and
&#145;lateral thinking&#146; </p>

<p><b>Vertical thinking</b> <br>
Vertical thinking is where we base our thought processes on our
prior knowledge, our experience and logic <br>
Our thought processes are based on assumptions and follow a
logical sequence <br>
This is the natural form of thinking <br>
It constrains our creativity and ability to solve problems </p>

<p>I was told the gate will be closed, so there is no point in
checking it </p>

<p><b>Lateral thinking</b> <br>
A set of systematic techniques used for changing concepts and
perceptions and generating new ones <br>
More generally - exploring multiple possibilities and approaches
instead of pursuing a single approach </p>

<p>The &#145;six hats&#146; is one of de Bono&#146;s techniques </p>

<p>I could check the gate before I jump the fence <br>
Is this fence in front of me really the second fence I have to
get over? </p>

<p>If we are innocent or ignorant of the &#145;done thing&#146;,
we can produce very creative solutions <br>
Children and non-experts can sometimes produce creative solutions
to problems <br>
If we are neither innocent or ignorant, we can employ lateral
thinking techniques to help us be creative </p>

<p>There is a story of a group of women being shown around a war
time factory <br>
Someone mentioned a problem in the sharpening of carbon
electrodes used in search lights <br>
One of the women suggested using a pencil sharpener <br>
It worked! </p>

<p>de Bono has provided the world with a number of techniques
that can be used to stimulate lateral thinking <br>
The &#145;six hats&#146; is not a lateral thinking technique per
se, rather a structured process for introducing lateral thinking
into problem solving, particularly in groups </p>

<p><b>de Bono&#146;s &#145;Six Hats&#146;</b> <br>
de Bono describes the six hats as a &#145;game&#146; <br>
but you should be carefully not to underestimate the power in its
simplicity <br>
Many major international organisations use this technique for
problem solving </p>

<p>&nbsp;Each &#145;hat&#146; represents a perspective or way of
thinking <br>
They are metaphorical hats that a thinker can put on or take off
to indicate the type of thinking they are using <br>
In a group we can ask members to &#145;put on&#146; different
hats in a sequence to aide the problem solving process </p>

<p>This can help overcome the problem of each group member
adopting random positions at random times <br>
It also permits us to control people who insist of sticking to
one perspective (ie. negative) - we can ask them to assume a
different hat </p>

<p>Let&#146;s describe the various hats we can wear </p>

<p><b>The white hat</b> <br>
White is neutral <br>
While wearing the white hat we ignore arguments and proposals, <br>
we examine the facts, figures and information that we have, and <br>
identify what information we don&#146;t have, and how we might
get it </p>

<p>What information do we have here? <br>
What information is missing? <br>
What information would we like to have? <br>
How are we going to get the information? </p>

<p><b>The red hat</b> <br>
Red is for feelings, hunches and intuition <br>
It permits people to put forward their feelings without the need
for apology, explanation or attempt to justify them <br>
Intuition may be a composite judgement based on years of
experience, and <br>
it can be valuable even if the reasons behind it cannot be
spelled out consciously </p>

<p>Putting on my red hat, this is what I think about the project
... <br>
My gut feeling is that it will not work <br>
I don&#146;t like the way this is being done <br>
My intuition tells me that prices will fall soon </p>

<p><b>The black hat</b> <br>
The black hat is the logical negative <br>
It is the hat of caution &amp; critical judgement <br>
It is the most used hat, and perhaps the most valuable hat,
mistakes may be disastrous <br>
At the same time, it is very easy to overuse the black hat, it is
easy to kill creative ideas with early negativity </p>

<p>The regulations do not permit us to do that <br>
We do not have the production capacity to meet that order <br>
When we tried a higher price the sales fell off <br>
He has no experience in export management </p>

<p><b>The yellow hat</b> <br>
The yellow hat is for optimism and the logical positive view of
things <br>
It looks for feasibility and how something can be done <br>
It looks for benefits, but they must be logically based </p>

<p>That might work if we moved the production plant nearer to the
customers <br>
The benefit would come from repeat purchases <br>
The high cost of energy would make everyone more energy efficient
</p>

<p><b>The green hat</b> <br>
The green hat is for creative thinking, new ideas and additional
alternatives <br>
Putting on the green hat makes time and space for creative effort
<br>
This is were we engage in lateral thinking and other creative
techniques </p>

<p>We need some new ideas here <br>
Are there any additional alternatives? <br>
Could we do this in a different way? <br>
Could there be another explanation? </p>

<p><b>The blue hat</b> <br>
The blue hat is the thinking overview or process control hat <br>
It is usually used by the chairperson of the meeting: <br>
it sets the agenda for thinking; <br>
it suggests the next step for thinking; <br>
it asks for summaries, conclusions and decisions </p>

<p>We have spent far too much time looking for someone to blame <br>
Could we have a summary of your views? <br>
I think we should take a look at the priorities <br>
I suggest we try some green hat thinking to get some new ideas </p>

<p><b>de Bono&#146;s &#145;Six Hats&#146;</b> <br>
It is common for meetings to get bogged down in arguments where
people take positions and defend them to the death <br>
The 6 hats is a cooperative tool rather than a adversarial tool <br>
In a normal meeting, it is easy for someone not to look for
positives if they do not support an idea - the 6 hats technique
challenges participants to see all sides </p>

<p>Some people see the downside in everything <br>
The 6 hats technique offers them ample opportunity for black hat
thinking, <br>
but challenges them to think in other ways as well <br>
It is important the hats are not categories or labels for people <br>
rather than limiting people, the aim of the 6 hats is to get the
thinker to use all 6 hats </p>

<p>Some times it is possible to put together a sequence of hats
that will assist in thinking productively about some matter </p>

<p>The actual order will vary with the situation, <br>
but for a new matter, the sequence might be: </p>

<p><b>The six hats - for a new problem</b> </p>

<ul>
    <li>White - to get information;</li>
    <li>Green - for ideas and proposals;</li>
    <li>Yellow followed by Black on each alternative - to
        evaluate alternatives;</li>
    <li>Red - to assess feelings at this point;</li>
    <li>Blue - to decide what thinking to do next</li>
</ul>

<p><b>For a well known idea</b> <br>
For a well known proposal, the sequence of hats might run: </p>

<ul>
    <li>red;</li>
    <li>yellow;</li>
    <li>black;</li>
    <li>green (to overcome negative points);</li>
    <li>white; and then</li>
    <li>blue</li>
</ul>
