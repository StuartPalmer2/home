<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">University graduate employment
outcomes are a topic of international importance.&nbsp; In Australia,
in recent years, employment rates for engineering graduates have
declined significantly.&nbsp; What has not been clear is what type of
jobs those graduates in work have been obtaining.&nbsp; A clearer
understanding of the occupational outcomes, both short- and long-term,
are needed for the rational design of university engineering curricula.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The research presented here seeks to
understand the nature of the occupational outcomes for Australian
engineering bachelor graduates - of particular interest is the
proportion of graduates working outside the discipline and how
curricula prepare graduates for this.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Australian national census data from
2006, 2011 and 2016 were examined to identify the occupational outcomes
for engineering bachelor graduates.&nbsp; This was combined with
complementary census data identifying who works in a professional
engineering role.&nbsp; The influence of student diversity is also
considered.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Over the period 2006-2016, the
percentage of engineering bachelor graduates in employment has declined
across most age ranges, but the decline has been particularly stark for
those in the new graduate age range.&nbsp; The proportion of
engineering bachelor graduates working in a professional engineering
role has also declined, and for new graduates this proportion reached
very low levels in 2016.&nbsp; In Australia, engineering bachelor
qualified people make up a minority of those reporting working in a
professional engineering role.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The Australian national census data
over the period 2006-2016 reveal the complexity/diversity of
occupational outcomes for engineering bachelor graduates &ndash; many
will work out of a professional engineering role if they wish to work
at all, and the Australian professional engineering workforce is very
diverse, including many people without an engineering bachelor
qualification.&nbsp; These results have important implications for
those with the responsibility for the design of undergraduate
engineering curricula to best prepare students for the future work
environment that they will graduate into, which are discussed in this
paper.&nbsp; The analysis of three cycles of census data establishes a
benchmark time series that will be useful for future research.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
