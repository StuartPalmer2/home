<p class="Abstract"><span lang="EN-GB">The Australian census data revealed that in
2016 only 25 per cent of all engineering bachelor (BE) graduates were working
in a professional engineering (PE) occupation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other research indicates that this overall result will mask differences
in outcomes for BE graduates based on gender and age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, we use the latest Australian census
data to identify the impact and interaction of gender and age on occupational
outcomes for Australian BE graduates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The analysis here includes the outcomes of broad occupational
classification, weekly income, and weekly hours worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Female BE graduates are less likely to be
working in PE role, less likely to be working at all, more likely to have a
lower income, and more likely to be working less hours per week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>New BE graduates are less likely to be
working at all, and more likely to be working in a part-time work pattern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>New female BE graduates are least likely to
be working at all, have the lowest median income, and most likely to be working
in a very low weekly hours part-time work pattern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We present the methods used to collect these
data and a discussion of the implications of these results for Australian
undergraduate engineering education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
