The importance of science for national innovation and competition is recognised
internationally, and drives concerns about the adequacy of national STEM
(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is known that many Australian science
graduates do not work in a science occupation in the longer term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The makeup of the Australian science
workforce is less well known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rational
education design dictates that science curricula should be based on a realistic
representation of the actual practice of Australian science graduates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latest Australian national census data
are analysed to: identify where Bachelor of Science graduates work; identify
who works in science occupations; and reveal the complexity of the Australian
science workforce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Australian
science workforce is comprised of people with a wide range of educational
qualifications, and, even immediately post-graduation, many Australian science
graduates pursue non-science occupations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Beyond curriculum models that aim to prepare graduates for careers in
research and industrial science practice, actual Australian science
occupational outcomes point to the value of curricula that also address career
options in non-science STEM occupations, non-STEM occupations, and the
development of enterprise/entrepreneurial skills that would assist graduates to
create their own businesses and employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
